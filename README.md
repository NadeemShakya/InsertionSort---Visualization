# Insertion Sort

  The insertion sort is similar to arranging cards in our hand. <br>
  We choose one card at a time from a pack of cards on the table facing downwards, and arrange them accordingly in our hand.
  <br>
  Trivially, the first card in our hand will be sorted automatically.
  <br>
  It has the worst case time complexity of O(n * n). <br>
  It is an inplace, stable sorting algorithm.
